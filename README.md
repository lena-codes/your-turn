This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The purpose is to randomly choose an entry from a self created list.

## Tech

I used

- Next.js & vercel
- redux
- tailwindCSS

## Build it

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
